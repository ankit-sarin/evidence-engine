prospero_id: null

pico:
  population: >-
    Studies involving autonomous or semi-autonomous surgical robotic systems
    performing physical surgical tasks on tissue, phantoms, or in-vivo models.
  intervention: >-
    Any level of surgical autonomy (Levels 1–5 per the Yang et al. taxonomy),
    ranging from robot assistance under continuous human control to fully
    autonomous task execution.
  comparator: >-
    Human-controlled (teleoperated) surgical systems, manual surgery,
    or no comparator.
  outcomes:
    - Task accuracy or error rate
    - Task completion time
    - Safety events (tissue damage, unplanned stops, collisions)
    - Autonomy level achieved (Yang et al. Level 1–5)
    - Surgeon workload or cognitive load metrics
